    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Serenity (Light Beige, Muted Green, Soft Orange, Dark Brown-Gray) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single, centered container divided into two main sections: a "Generate Numbers" area at the top and a "Historical Analysis" area at the bottom. This structure allows users to both interact with the generator and review past data on one page. The "Generate Numbers" section includes a button and clear displays for the main and additional numbers. The "Historical Analysis" section features a Chart.js bar chart to visualize number frequencies from provided history, providing valuable context without suggesting predictive power. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        Report Info: New TOTO numbers (6 main, 1 additional). Goal: Action & Inform. Viz/Presentation: HTML button, large styled number "pills". Interaction: Click to generate a new set. Justification: Clear action, easy-to-read numbers, visually distinct main vs. additional. Method: Vanilla JS.
        Report Info: Historical TOTO draw frequencies. Goal: Analyze & Inform. Viz/Presentation: Bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Static display of frequencies. Justification: Visually summarizes number popularity from history, making dense data consumable. Method: Chart.js.
        Report Info: Explanatory text for TOTO rules and historical analysis. Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation: Text blocks. Justification: Provides necessary context for both the generation function and the historical data. Method: HTML.

    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            // Each inner array represents a single TOTO draw, with the first 6 numbers
            // being the main draw and the 7th number being the additional/bonus number.
            // After editing, save the file and refresh the page to see the updated analysis.
            // Example:
            // historyData.push([11, 22, 33, 44, 5, 6, 7]); // Add a new draw
            // Or
            // historyData[0] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]; // Modify an existing draw
        });
